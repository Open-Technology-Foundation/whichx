.TH WHICHX 1 "2025" "whichx 2.0" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
whichx \- locate a command (enhanced which replacement)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B whichx
[\fIOPTIONS\fR]
.IR filename ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B whichx
is a robust bash implementation of the classic Unix
.BR which (1)
command and serves as a fully-compatible drop-in replacement.
.PP
.B whichx
returns the pathnames of the files (or links) which would be executed
in the current environment, had its arguments been given as commands in a
strictly POSIX-conformant shell. It does this by searching the
.B PATH
for executable files matching the names of the arguments.
.PP
While functionally compatible with the standard
.BR which (1)
command,
.B whichx
provides more robust error handling, better POSIX compliance, and
additional features for modern shell scripting.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-a ", " \-\-all
Print all matching pathnames of each argument. By default, only the first
match in PATH is displayed.
.TP
.BR \-c ", " \-\-canonical
Print canonical paths using
.BR realpath (1).
This resolves all symbolic links and relative path components.
.TP
.BR \-s ", " \-\-silent
Silent mode. No output is produced; only the exit code indicates success
or failure. Exit 0 if all executables are found, 1 otherwise.
.TP
.BR \-V ", " \-\-version
Print version information and exit.
.TP
.BR \-h ", " \-\-help
Display help message and exit.
.SH EXIT STATUS
.TP
.B 0
All specified commands found successfully.
.TP
.B 1
One or more commands not found.
.TP
.B 2
Usage error (no arguments provided).
.TP
.B 22
Invalid command-line option.
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
Find the location of the ls command:
.PP
.nf
.RS
whichx ls
.RE
.fi
.PP
Find all python executables in PATH:
.PP
.nf
.RS
whichx \-a python
.RE
.fi
.PP
Show canonical path for vim (following symlinks):
.PP
.nf
.RS
whichx \-c vim
.RE
.fi
.PP
Check multiple commands at once:
.PP
.nf
.RS
whichx ls cat grep
.RE
.fi
.PP
Silent mode - check if commands exist without output:
.PP
.nf
.RS
if whichx \-s docker; then
    echo "Docker is installed"
else
    echo "Docker not found"
fi
.RE
.fi
.PP
Use in script pre-flight checks:
.PP
.nf
.RS
#!/bin/bash
# Check for required dependencies
if ! whichx \-s gcc make cmake; then
    echo "Error: Missing required tools" >&2
    exit 1
fi
.RE
.fi
.SH IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
.PP
.B whichx
properly handles empty PATH elements by treating them as the current
directory (.), ensuring strict POSIX compliance.
.PP
Combined short options are supported (e.g.,
.I \-ac
is equivalent to
.I "\-a \-c"
).
.PP
The exit code is only successful (0) if
.I all
specified targets are found.
